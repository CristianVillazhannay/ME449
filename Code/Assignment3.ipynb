    "The strange behavior that I see in the simulation if I choose the damping constant to be a large positive value - in my simulation this is a value of 4 and above - is that the theta values quickly grow towards infinity, leading to overflow errors or the generation of _NaN_ values in Python. This leads to a CoppeliaSim .csv that is unable to run since CoppeliaSim cannot translate these numbers approaching infinity. I believe that the higher positive damping force leads the damping torques to create overshoot in the theta angle position. This overshoot then causes the following damping force to overcorrect, leading to large oscillatory torques that cause the robot arm to swing at larger angles until they approach infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the timestep is shortened, the function is capable of handling damping values of 4 and above. The reason why is likely because the overshoot error is minimized when the time horizon over which it is calculated (i.e, dt = 0.001) is smaller. This leads to less drastic overshoot and subsequently smaller overcorrections. "
