# ME449

This is where I have compiled my code for ME 449: Robotic Manipulation. 

The class covers representations of the configuration and spatial motion of rigid bodies and robots based on modern screw theory.  Forward, inverse, and differential kinematics.  Robot dynamics, trajectory planning, and motion control.  Wheeled mobile robots and mobile manipulation.
